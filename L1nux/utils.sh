## configuration

  ## Ubuntu

    ## jockey

      # Additional drivers : non-free vendors

      # List:

        jockey-text --list

      # Enable from list. E.g.: xorg:fglrx_updates:

## Programming

  ## pkg-config

    #info is contained in "$PKG_NAME.pc" files located mainly under:

      #/usr/share/pkgconfig/
      #/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/

    #a part of program installation may be to put files there

    #usage in in a makefile:

      CFLAGS=$(shell pkg-config --cflags pkgname)
      LIBS=$(shell pkg-config --libs pkgname)

  ## source-highlight

  # Takes in source files and produces highlighted output in one of the formats:

  # - html
  # - ansi terminal escape sequences
  # - pdf

  # List all languages supported:

    source-highlight --lang-list

  # Generate an `a.html` highlighted version of `a.py`:

    source-highlight a.py

## pygments

  #python package for multi language syntax coloring.

  #take python source, output colored html:

    pygmentize -O full -o test.html test.py
    firefox test.html &

  #-O: options.
    #full is required here, otherwise there would be no header,
    #and the style info would not be put in the html

  #input and output formats here were inferred from extension,
  #but can be explicitly set too.

## c99

  #On Linux as of 2013, acts as a simple GCC frontend.

  #At first glance `gcc -std=c99` is largely compatible with the POSIX c99.

## Users and groups

  # To play around with those in Ubuntu, do ctrl+alt+f2, f3 ... f7
  # and you will go into login shells
  # so you can log with different users at the same time.

  # List users:

    cat /etc/passwd | sort

  # Sample output:

    #ciro:x:1000:1000:ciro,,,:/home/ciro:/bin/bash

  # - `ciro`: user name
  # - `x`: password is encrypted and stored in /etc/shadow
  # - `1000`: user id. 0: root. 1-99: predefined. 100-999: reserved by system. 1000: first `normal` user
  # - `1000`: primary user group
  # - `ciro,,,` : comment field. Used by finger command.
  # - `/home/ciro`: home dir
  # - `/bin/bash`: login shell

  # You are likely to see many users beside those which have a home directory.

  # This is so because many applications create their own users.

  # List groups:

    cat /etc/group

  # Format:

    #groupname:x:5:user1,user2,user3
    #x: encrypted pass if any
    #5: group id. `regular` groups start at 1000

  # Cat line of /etc/group for group g

    getent group "$g"

    cat /etc/default/useradd

  ## groups

    # List groups of user `"$u"`:

      groups

  ## who

    # POSIX 7.

    # List who is logged on system.

      who

  ## whoami

    # Same as `id -un`, but not POSIX, so never rely on it.

  ## last

      last

  ## getty

    # The tty that runs on those ctrl-alt-F\d things:

  ## useradd

    # Create a new user with username `$u`:

      u=
      sudo useradd -ms /bin/bash $u
      sudo passwd "$u"

    # For users that represent human end users, you will amost always want to use the following:

    # - `-m` make home dir owned the user him with permissions 707.

      # Without `-m` it is possible that X11 won't work.

      # A tty login starts at `/`.

      # Initial home dir files will me copied from a default template located at `/etc/skel`

      # To change this template use: `-k /path/to/skel/`.

      # Ro create no files: `-k /dev/null`

      # If you forgot to use `-m` when you created the user this can be corrected by doing:

        sudo mkdir /home/$u
        sudo chmod 700 /home/$u $u
        sudo chown /home/$u $u

    # - `-p pass`

      # Set password for the user.

      # It is possible to create an user without a password,
      # but then he won't be able to login.

      # This has the disadvantage that the password will be visible.

      # To create a password without showing it on screen,
      # consider using the `passwd` command.

    # - `-s` sets login shell

      # You should probably set this to `/bin/bash`.

      # If you forgot this, consider using chsh.

    # - `-g 1001`: set group the user belongs to

      # If g missing, either create a group u and add user
      # to a default group specified in some config file

    # - `-G 1002, 1003`: set secondary groups

    # - `-c '$fullname,$office,$office2,$homephone'`

      # Comment field thatwill end up on `/etc/passwd`.

      # Any string is possiblt, but this particular format is recognized by the `finger` command
      # and should always be used.

      # To change this afterwards consier the `chfn` command.

    # - `e`: password expires automatically at the given date.

    # - `f`: account disables 5 days after password expires if pass not changed.

    # Actual passwords are normally stored hashed in the `/etc/shadow` file.

    # Modify passwd for cur user:

      passwd

    # Modify passwd for user u:

      sudo passwd "$u"

    # If you are not u, you need sudo.

    # Delete passwd for u, disabling login on his account:

      sudo passwd -d "$u"

    # Delete passwd for u, disabling login on his account
    # until a new passwd is created.

    # Lock account of user:

      sudo passwd -l "$u"

    # He cannot login anymore.
    # `sudo su` and ssh public key based logins still work since they don't use the user's password.
    # `sudo -u $u` also works.

    # On the `/etc/shadow` file, an exclamation mark was added
    # before hash of the password:

      sudo cat /etc/shadow

  ## makepasswd
